This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```
## Braindump

This is a relatively simple idea-sharing platform that uses Next JS and Tailwind in the frontend and Firebase in the backend. Authentication and database functionality are implemented. I want to add voting system, comments and community functionality in the future. 

This project is still a work in progress. It's also a personal project, so I'm still not sure what to do with it in the long term.
